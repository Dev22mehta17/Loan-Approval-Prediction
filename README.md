# Loan-Approval-Prediction
The Loan Approval Prediction project aims to automate and improve the decision-making process for approving loan applications using machine learning. By analyzing key factors such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, employment status, and other financial indicators, the model predicts the likelihood of loan approval.

This project likely involves data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling), exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, and training machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or advanced deep learning models. The goal is to enhance accuracy, reduce manual processing time, and assist financial institutions in making data-driven lending decisions efficiently.
